    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <p>
            Matcha Cake

            1 ¼ cup all-purpose flour (175 g)
            2 tablespoon matcha powder (11 g)
            ½ teaspoon baking soda
            1 teaspoon baking powder
            ¾ cup granulated sugar (141 g)
            ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
            ¾ cup buttermilk (175 g)
            ½ cup vegetable oil (105 g)
            1 large egg
            ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
        
        Whipped cream
        
            1 cup heavy whipping cream (236 g)
            ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
            ¼ cup granulated sugar (47 g)
            ½ - 1 teaspoon matcha powder

        Notes

            Use culinary matcha powder for baking, make sure your matcha powder is pure tea powder and not a matcha powder mix used to make matcha latte.
            The whipped cream will last as long as the cupcakes without any stabilizing agent, but make sure you beat until stiff peaks.
            You can stabilize the whipped cream using ½ - 1 teaspoon of gelatin powder, bloom it in a tablespoon of water, microwave until completely dissolved, and mix this in with the whipped cream while it is at soft peak stage and continue beating until stiff peaks.

            <li>Allow the cupcakes to cool in the pan for 10 - 15 minutes until cool to the touch before removing them from the pan and setting them on a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
