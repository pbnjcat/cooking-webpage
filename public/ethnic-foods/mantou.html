    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <p>
            1 cup milk
            1 teaspoon active dry yeast
            2 1/2 tablespoons sugar
            350 g (12.3 oz. or about 2 3/4 cups) all-purpose flour 
            
            Notes

            Please use the metric measurement for the flour.
            You may use whole milk, low fat milk or skim milk. You can replace milk with water or soy milk. For the best flavors, you may use 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream plus half cup full milk.
            If you don't have a stand mixer, knead the dough by hands, for 15-20 minutes or until the dough becomes smooth on the surface.
            If the dough is still sticky after kneading for 6 minutes, you may add 1-2 tablespoons of flour to bind the dough.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <ol>
            <li>Add the milk, yeast and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer attached with a dough hook. Stir the mixture with a pair of chopsticks or a spoon. </li>
            <li>Add the flour to the yeast mixture. Turn on speed 1 and knead the ingredients until it forms a smooth dough, about 6 minutes. If the dough starts to "climb up" the dough hook, stop the stand mixer and push the dough down to the bowl. </li>
            <li>Transfer the dough out and cover it with plastic wrap and let rest for 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>On a slightly floured surface, roll out the dough with a rolling pin, from bottom to top. </li>
            <li>Turn the dough horizontally and roll from bottom to top. </li>
            <li>Continue to roll out the dough to form a 14x10" rectangle. </li>
            <li>Roll up the dough into a log, from left to right. Make sure you tuck and roll the dough so it forms a tight log. </li>
            <li>Roll out the log a few times or until the surface looks smooth and reaches 12-inch in length.</li>
            <li>Cut the dough into 8 equal-sized pieces using a sharp knife. Transfer each dough to a 3x4"-inch parchment paper. You may roll each dough into a round ball after cutting. </li>
            <li>Place the dough into a steamer. Cover the lid of the steamer and let rise for 60 minutes, or until the dough balls expand in size. Make sure you leave enough space between each dough ball so they don't stick together.</li>
            <li>Add water to the bottom of the steamer. You may add 1 teaspoon of Chinese white vinegar to make the steamed buns whiter. Cover the lid tightly. </li>
            <li>Turn on high heat and steam for 10-12 minutes, or until the dough expands to soft, puffy and fluffy steamed buns. Turn off the heat and serve the steamed buns warm. Dip with condensed milk if you like sweet steamed buns. </li>
          </ol>
