    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <p>
            2 cups (227g) chopped dates
            4 tablespoons (57g) softened butter
            1 teaspoon baking soda
            3/4 teaspoon salt
            2/3 to 3/4 cup (142g to 159g) light brown sugar or dark brown sugar, packed
            1 cup (227g) brewed coffee, hot
            1 large egg
            1 teaspoon vanilla extract
            1 tablespoon (14g) vodka or brandy, optional; to enhance flavor
            1/2 teaspoon baking powder
            1 3/4 cups (210g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
            1 cup (113g) coarsely chopped walnuts
        </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Place the dates, butter, baking soda, salt, and brown sugar in a mixing bowl. Pour the hot coffee into the bowl, stirring to combine. Allow the mixture to cool for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the egg, vanilla, liquor, baking powder, and flour, beating gently until smooth. Stir in the walnuts.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the pan, gently tapping the pan on the counter to settle the batter.</li>
            <li>Bake the bread for 45 to 55 minutes, tenting the loaf gently with foil after 30 minutes, to prevent over-browning. Remove the bread from the oven; a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean, and an instant-read thermometer should read about 200°F.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes, gently turn the bread out of the pan onto a rack to cool. Cool completely before slicing. Wrap airtight, and store at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.</li>
